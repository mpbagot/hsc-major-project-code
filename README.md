# HSC Major Project MMORPG

For my HSC major project, I am creating a simple MMORPG that allows players to play together on either a local network or over the internet.
The game can be played singleplayer, but is created with the multiplayer experience in mind.

### Setting up:
Getting the game running from source code only involves a couple of steps.
Firstly, ensure that your computer has the following dependencies installed:
##### Linux:
 - Python3 Packages (Installed using pip3):
  - pygame
  - noise
 - python3
 - python3-dev
 - cython3

Once these dependencies are installed, simply compile the API (instructions in api folder's README.md), and run:
> python3 main.py

Extra command line arguments (see below) can also be added to change the game's behaviour if you wish.

### Command Line Arguments:

TODO fill this in.
